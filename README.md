# Golf Replay

A web app for recording your golf swing and instantly replaying it — first at normal speed, then in slow motion.

**Live app:** <a href="https://larsselstad.github.io/golfreplay/" target="_blank">https://larsselstad.github.io/golfreplay/</a>

---

## How it works

1. Open the app — your camera preview fills the screen
2. **Tap the screen** (or press a keyboard key) to start a countdown — or arm the 👁 face trigger and look at the camera
3. Swing! Recording starts automatically when the countdown ends
4. Tap (or trigger) again to stop recording
5. The clip replays immediately: once at 1× speed, then once at 0.5× slow motion
6. The app returns to live preview, ready for the next swing

## Controls

| Action | Input |
|---|---|
| Start countdown / Stop recording / Skip replay | Tap the screen or press a keyboard key (Space, Enter, arrow keys) |
| Hands-free start | Tap 👁 to arm face trigger, then hold eye contact for 1.5 s |
| Hands-free stop | After swing, look back at camera and hold eye contact for 1 s |
| Switch camera on/off | Tap the 📷 button (bottom-right corner) |
| Open settings | Tap the ⚙️ gear icon |

## Face trigger

Tap the 👁 button (bottom-right corner, front camera only) to arm face trigger mode. A green dwell ring fills over 1.5 s while you look directly at the camera — when it completes, the countdown starts. The mode stays active across all shots in the session; tap 👁 again to disarm.

**Stopping with face trigger:** Once recording is running, look away to take your swing. After the swing, look back at the camera and hold eye contact for 1 s — recording stops automatically. The app won't trigger the stop while you're still looking at the camera at the start; it waits until your face has turned away (during the swing) before the stop gesture becomes active.

> **Tip:** Position the phone so your face fills a reasonable portion of the frame. Very small faces at long distances may not be detected reliably.

## Using remotely (GitHub Pages)

Open **https://larsselstad.github.io/golfreplay/** in Safari on your iPad or iPhone.

> **Note:** Camera access requires HTTPS, which GitHub Pages provides automatically.

## Node.js version

This project uses [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to pin the Node.js version. The required version is specified in `.nvmrc`.

To switch to the correct version:

```bash
nvm use
```

If you don't have that version installed yet:

```bash
nvm install
```

---

## Code quality

[Biome](https://biomejs.dev) is used for linting and formatting.

```bash
npm run lint    # lint js/**/*.js and css/**/*.css
npm run format  # format js/**/*.js and css/**/*.css in place
npm run check   # lint + format together (use before committing)
```

---

## Running locally on Mac

1. Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed (see above for the pinned version)
2. In the project folder, run:

```bash
npx serve .
```

3. Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser

> **Note:** `localhost` is treated as a secure context by browsers, so camera access works without HTTPS.
